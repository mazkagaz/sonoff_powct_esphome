## ‚ú® Key Features

This custom ESPHome firmware allows me to fully utilize the Sonoff POW CT, providing essential energy monitoring features, especially for solar installations:

* **Advanced Bidirectional Measurement**
    * Reading of **positive** (consumption) and **negative** (production) current and power values.
    * Fast updates, with a new value per second.

* **Advanced Debugging Tools**
    * Built-in functions to directly read and write to the measurement component registers via Home Assistant **Actions**:
        * `my_sonoff_powct_read_register`
        * `my_sonoff_powct_write_register`

* **Precision Calibration**
    * The ability to perform fine calibration of measurements to ensure **optimal accuracy**.

* **Native Integration**
    * Perfect and local integration with Home Assistant via the native ESPHome API (No Cloud).

## üöÄ Next Steps (Roadmap)

I am actively working on improving this configuration. Planned features for upcoming versions include:

* **Separate Energy Meters**
    * Direct reading of accumulated energy, with dedicated energy sensors for **import** (total consumption) and **export** (total production).
* **Additional Diagnostics**
    * Addition of extra diagnostic sensors (Voltage, Power Factor, etc.).
