## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Flashing Procedure

To perform the **initial firmware flash** on your device, you'll need to follow a few hardware preparation steps.

---

### **Step 1: Hardware Preparation (üö® Power OFF!)**

First, you must **open the device casing** while it is **powered OFF** (unplugged or disconnected from mains voltage) to ensure safety.

Inside the device, you need to **solder four connector wires** to the clearly marked programming points on the board: **3.3V, TX, RX, and GND**. These are the standard connections required for flashing ESP-based devices.

| Pin | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3.3V** | Power supply |
| **TX** | Transmit Data |
| **RX** | Receive Data |
| **GND** | Ground |

### **Step 2: Connecting to Your PC**

Next, you'll need an **USB-to-TTL Serial Adapter** to bridge the connection between the device and your computer. A common and reliable example is a module based on the **CP2102** chip.

1.  Connect the wires you just soldered on the device to the corresponding pins on the USB-to-TTL adapter:

    * Device **3.3V** $\rightarrow$ Adapter **3.3V**
    * Device **TX** $\rightarrow$ Adapter **RX**
    * Device **RX** $\rightarrow$ Adapter **TX**
    * Device **GND** $\rightarrow$ Adapter **GND**

2.  Plug the USB-to-TTL adapter into a free **USB port** on your PC.

üí° **Pro Tip:** Make sure to cross the TX/RX connections (**TX** to **RX** and **RX** to **TX**).

### **Step 3: Flashing the Firmware (ESPHome)**

Once the hardware is connected, you can proceed with the firmware upload using the ESPHome platform.

1.  Place the device into **Flashing/Bootloader Mode**. This can be achieved by pressing and holding the button while connecting the GND pin, but you may also need to experiment with the +3.3V pin to find the right connection timing...
2.  Use the **standard ESPHome flashing method** (e.g., the ESPHome Dashboard, command line, or the Web Flasher) to upload the firmware.
3.  Utilize the **YAML configuration templates** provided in the root of this repository.

**You may have to generate the firmware and download it to your PC (last option in ESPhome), and then use an external tool (**`esptool`**) to flash it onto your device.**

**With** `esptool`**, you may have to use the** `-nostub` **option.**
